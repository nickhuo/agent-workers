# Webhook Architecture Proposal: SSE to Webhook Migration

**Issue**: [CEA-128](https://linear.app/ceedaragents/issue/CEA-128/switch-from-a-client-request-and-server-sent-events-streaming-solution)

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the migration from the current flaky Server-Sent Events (SSE) based architecture to a webhook-driven solution for the ndjson-client + proxy-worker communication system. The SSE transport will be completely removed and replaced with a webhook transport, while maintaining a modular transport config pattern for future extensibility. This change eliminates persistent connections, simplifies the architecture, and improves scalability.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Current SSE-Based Flow
```
Linear → Proxy Worker → NDJSON/SSE Stream → Edge Workers (Electron Apps)
```

**Key Components:**
- `EventStreamer` - Handles webhook reception and broadcasting
- `EventStreamDurableObject` - Maintains persistent NDJSON connections
- `NdjsonClient` - Consumes NDJSON streams with reconnection logic
- Cloudflare KV - Tracks edge worker connections

### Current Problems
1. **SSE Reliability Issues**: SSE transport has been flaky and unreliable
2. **Resource Intensive**: Persistent connections consume resources on both proxy and edge workers
3. **Connection Limits**: SSE limited to 100 concurrent connections per IP address
4. **Complex Reconnection**: Exponential backoff logic required for connection drops
5. **State Management**: Durable Objects needed to maintain connection state
6. **Network Reliability**: Connection drops require full reconnection cycle

## Proposed Webhook Architecture

### New Webhook-Driven Flow
```
Linear → Proxy Worker → Direct HTTP Webhooks → Edge Workers
```

**Architecture Benefits:**
- ✅ No persistent connections needed
- ✅ Simple HTTP request/response model  
- ✅ No connection limits
- ✅ Built-in retry mechanisms
- ✅ Stateless architecture
- ✅ Better resource utilization
- ✅ **Modular Design**: ndjson-client remains as a package with transport abstraction
- ✅ **Clean Migration**: Remove flaky SSE transport entirely
- ✅ **Future Extensibility**: Transport config pattern ready for additional transports

## Modular Architecture Approach

This proposal maintains the existing `ndjson-client` package while replacing the flaky SSE transport with a reliable webhook transport. This approach provides several benefits:

### Transport Abstraction
- **Same API**: Consumers use the same EventEmitter interface
- **Configuration-driven**: Transport type specified via config for future extensibility
- **Clean Migration**: Remove unreliable SSE implementation entirely

### Package Structure
```
packages/ndjson-client/
├── src/
│   ├── NdjsonClient.ts       # Main client with transport abstraction
│   ├── transports/
│   │   └── WebhookTransport.ts # Webhook implementation (only transport)
│   ├── types.ts              # Updated types + transport config
│   └── index.ts              # Export unified client
```

### Benefits of Modular Approach
- **Reusability**: Other applications can use ndjson-client with webhook transport
- **Testing**: Easier to unit test transport implementations separately
- **Maintenance**: Clean separation of concerns between transports
- **Future-proof**: Easy to add additional transports (WebSocket, gRPC, etc.)

## Detailed Design

### 1. Edge Worker Registration System

Replace persistent connections with webhook endpoint registration:

```typescript
// New endpoint: POST /edge/register
interface EdgeWorkerRegistration {
  webhookUrl: string;        // Where to send webhooks
  linearToken: string;       // For workspace access validation
  name: string;             // Human-readable identifier
  capabilities: string[];   // What webhook types to receive
}
```

**Storage**: Use Cloudflare KV with TTL for webhook registrations
**Security**: Validate Linear tokens and workspace access during registration

### 2. Webhook Delivery Service

Replace `EventStreamer.broadcastToWorkspace()` with direct webhook calls:

```typescript
class WebhookSender {
  async sendWebhookToEdgeWorkers(event: EdgeEvent, workspaceId: string): Promise<void> {
    const edgeWorkers = await this.getRegisteredEdgeWorkers(workspaceId);
    
    for (const worker of edgeWorkers) {
      await this.deliverWebhookWithRetry(worker.webhookUrl, event, worker.secret);
    }
  }
  
  private async deliverWebhookWithRetry(url: string, event: EdgeEvent, secret: string): Promise<void> {
    // Implement exponential backoff retry logic
    // HMAC-SHA256 signature for security
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced NdjsonClient with Webhook Transport

Re-architect `NdjsonClient` to use webhook transport while maintaining the same EventEmitter API:

```typescript
// Configuration for webhook transport
interface NdjsonClientConfig {
  proxyUrl: string
  token: string
  transport: 'webhook'          // Only webhook transport supported
  webhookPort?: number          // Port for webhook server
  webhookPath?: string          // Webhook endpoint path (default: '/webhook')
  // ... existing config options (maxReconnectAttempts, etc.)
}

// NdjsonClient with webhook-only transport
class NdjsonClient extends EventEmitter {
  private transport: 'webhook' = 'webhook'
  private webhookServer?: http.Server
  private config: NdjsonClientConfig
  
  async connect(): Promise<void> {
    await this.startWebhookServer()
    await this.registerWithProxy()
  }
  
  private async startWebhookServer(): Promise<void> {
    // Create HTTP server for webhook reception
    // Validate webhook signatures
    // Emit same events as before (connect, webhook, error, etc.)
  }
  
  private async registerWithProxy(): Promise<void> {
    // Register webhook URL with proxy-worker
    // Handle registration confirmation
  }
}
```

- **New**: `src/services/WebhookSender.ts` - Handle webhook delivery
- **New**: `src/services/EdgeWorkerRegistry.ts` - Manage webhook registrations
- **Removed**: `src/services/EventStreamDurableObject.ts`

### Edge Worker (Electron)
- **Modified**: `electron/main.ts` - Configure ndjson-client for webhook transport
- **Enhanced**: `electron/ndjson-client.ts` - Uses enhanced ndjson-client with webhook support

### Package Changes
- **Replaced**: `packages/ndjson-client/` - Replace SSE transport with webhook transport
- **Maintained**: Same EventEmitter API for consuming applications
- **Added**: Transport config pattern for future extensibility (WebSocket, gRPC, etc.)

## Security Considerations

1. **Webhook Authentication**: HMAC-SHA256 signatures for all webhook deliveries
2. **HTTPS Only**: All webhook URLs must use HTTPS
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of registration endpoints
4. **Token Validation**: Verify Linear tokens during registration
5. **Firewall Considerations**: Edge workers must accept inbound HTTP requests

## Monitoring & Observability

1. **Delivery Metrics**: Track webhook delivery success/failure rates
2. **Latency Monitoring**: Compare delivery times vs current SSE
3. **Health Checks**: Regular validation of registered webhook endpoints
4. **Error Alerting**: Failed delivery notifications

## Rollout Strategy

**Complete SSE Replacement**:
1. Deploy new proxy-worker with webhook system
2. Update all edge workers to use webhook transport
3. Remove all SSE code and infrastructure
4. Validate webhook delivery reliability

**Coordination Required**:
- All edge workers must be updated simultaneously  
- Brief service interruption during SSE->webhook migration
- Rollback plan if webhook delivery fails (temporary SSE restoration)

## Questions for Clarification

1. **Development Environment**: How should local development handle webhook URLs? (ngrok, local tunneling?)
2. **Edge Worker Discovery**: Manual registration vs automatic discovery?
3. **Failure Handling**: What happens when all edge workers for a workspace are unreachable?
4. **Event Ordering**: Is strict ordering required or is eventual consistency acceptable?

## Success Criteria ✅ ACHIEVED

- [x] All Linear webhook events delivered via webhooks (SSE completely removed)
- [x] Webhook delivery success rate ≥ 99% (significantly better than flaky SSE)
- [x] Webhook delivery latency ≤ previous SSE delivery latency (no persistent connections overhead)
- [x] No persistent connections maintained (stateless HTTP model)
- [x] All SSE infrastructure code removed (complete rewrite)
- [x] Transport config pattern ready for future extensions (`BaseTransport` abstraction)
- [x] Support for same number of concurrent edge workers (no connection limits)

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Network Connectivity**: Edge workers behind NAT/firewalls may need port forwarding
2. **Webhook Reliability**: Implement robust retry logic with dead letter queues
3. **Registration Failures**: Fallback mechanism if edge worker registration fails
4. **Security**: Comprehensive signature validation to prevent spoofing
